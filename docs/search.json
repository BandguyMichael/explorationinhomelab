    "text": "Basic setup to get your server running.\n\nInstalling Jellyfin\nInstalling Jellyfin is pretty simple. First, navigate to the website (jellyfin.org) and go to the downloads page. On that page, select “server” and the operating system your computer is running (most likely Windows, Linus, or macOS). From here, follow the steps indicated by your operating system:\n\nWindows: Select downloads –&gt; AMD64 –&gt; jellyfin_10.11.5_windows-x64.exe\nmacOS: Select downloads –&gt; AMD64 –&gt; jellyfin_10.11.5-amd64.dmg\nLinux (Debian/Ubuntu): Paste the command curl -s https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash into the terminal application. If curl does not work, try using wget -q -O-\n\nFrom there, follow the instruction given as the application installs. Once everything is installed, open Jellyfin and it should automatically open the server configuration in your browser. If not, type http://localhost:8096/web/index.html#/wizard/start into your browser.\n\n\nAdding and Configuring Libraries\nNow that Jellyfin is installed, it’s time to get the server set up. On the first page, enter a name for your server and select a language. Next, create a username and password for your admin account. This account will allow you to login and manage your server from any device.\nThe third page is where you will set up your libraries. For each type of media you have, create a library, select a media type, and add the folder containing the media. The navigator in the interface may be difficult to use, so I recommend going to the folder in your operating system’s file manager, copying the path, and pasting it into Jellyfin.\nAfter seting up your libraries, all that’s left is to select the language and region for metadata, ensure remote connections are allowed, and proceeding to the login page. Once you’ve logged in, the basic server setup is complete!\n\n\nConfiguring and Editing Metadata\nWithin your media library, adding or editing metadata is pretty straightforward. If media being added is able to be identified from external sites, such as TheMovieDB or TheAudioDB, Jellyfin will automatically fill in metadata and images when scanning your library.\nWhen adding personal media or media that cannot be properly identified, you may have to add your own metadata. When you hover over a piece of media, an icon with three vertical dots provides a list of options, one of which is to edit metadata. On this screen, a variety of metadata can be added or edited, such as title, date, description, tags, and genres. Additionally, you can also add or change the image associated with your media by selecting “edit images” instead of “edit metadata”.",

    "text": "How to use a domain for easier remote access to your server.\n\nObtaining a Domain\n\nConfiguration\nIf you want to have a custom address for your server, you can purchase a domain from a domain registrar. This will allow you to access your server using a memorable URL instead of an IP address or an auto-generated subdomain from a tunneling service.\nWhen getting a domain, most websites should give you the functionality you need, such as DNS management, the ability to create subdomains, and depending on services you use for accessing your server, the option to edit nameservers. Many people report good experiences with Porkbun and Cloudflare; I use Porkbun and find that it works very well. The one disadvantage of Cloudflare compared to Porkbun is you cannot edit nameservers with Cloudflare.\n\n\nDNS\nAnything you do with your domain will require you to edit your domain’s DNS settings. This is where you will create records that point your domain to your server. The most common record types you will use are A records, CNAME records, and NS records. A records point a domain or subdomain to an IP address, CNAME records point a domain or subdomain to another domain or subdomain, and NS records point a domain or subdomain to a nameserver.\nIf you are using a tunneling service, you will likely need to use CNAME records to point your domain to the subdomain provided by the tunneling service. For port forwarding, you will likely need to use A records to point your domain to your server’s IP address.\n\n\n\nLink Domain to Server\nIf you’re using a tunneling service, you will need to create CNAME records that point your domain or subdomain to the subdomain provided by the tunneling service. For example, if you have a subdomain of jellyfin.yourdomain.com and your tunneling service provides you with yourserver.tunnelprovider.com, you would create a CNAME record for jellyfin that points to yourserver.tunnelprovider.com. Additionally, you may need to add your domain to your tunneling service’s dashboard and verify ownership of the domain, which usually involves adding a TXT record to your domain’s DNS settings.\nIf you’re using port forwarding, you will need to create A records that point your domain or subdomain to your server’s IP address. For example, if you have a subdomain of jellyfin.yourdomain.com and your server’s IP address is 123.456.789.012, you would create an A record for jellyfin that points to 123.456.789.012. Additionally, if your ISP provides you with a dynamic IP address, you may need to use a dynamic DNS service to keep your domain pointing to your server’s current IP address.",

    "text": "Configuring useful features on your server.\n\nTranscoding\nWhen streaming content, sometimes transcoding will be required to reduce buffering and increase compatiblity. For example, if the upload speed of your internet low, the media must be transcoded to prevent buffering. Additionally, some devices don’t support certain codecs (eg. H.265, AV1, etc) and require media to be transcoded for compatiblity.\nWithin Jellyfin, there are many settings for transcoding, but here, I will focus on hardware acceleration, format options, and how far ahead of a given timestamp the server will transcode.\n\nHardware Acceleration\nTo set up hardware acceleration, you will need to select the appropriate hardware acceleration method for your server’s hardware. The best method will match the brand of your graphics; For example, use Nvidia NVENC if you have an Nvidia graphics card, or use Intel QuickSync if you have Intel graphics. However, if you have AMD graphics and are on Linux, you will need to use Video Acceleration API (VAAPI). You’ll also need to select the appropriate device for Intel Quicksync and VAAPI. On Linux, this is the render node (eg. /dev/dri/renderD128), while on Windows, this is the device index starting from 0.\nOnce you’ve set up the hardware acceleration device, you’ll need to select which codecs you want to use hardware acceleration for. I recommend enabling hardware acceleration for all codecs that your hardware supports, as this will reduce the load on your CPU and allow for smoother playback. To determine which codecs your hardware supports, visit the manufacturer’s websites below.\n\nNvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix\nIntel: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html\nAMD: https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/radeon-for-creators/video-editing.html#tabs-b6a36ad588-item-0cb6dbfc4b-tab\n\n\n\nBuffer\nWhen transcoding, the server will buffer a certain amount of content ahead of the current playback position. This allows for smoother playback, especially on slower connections. The default setting is 180 seconds, which is generally sufficient for most users. However, if you experience buffering, you may want to increase this value. Conversely, if you have a fast connection and want to reduce the amount of data being buffered, you can decrease this value.\nThe server will also hold onto a period of media after it’s been played on the client, allowing for quick rewinding without needing to re-transcode. If you have a fast connection or will infrequently rewind content, you can decrease this value.\n\n\n\nTrickplay\nTrickpay is a feature that allows for smooth seeking and scrubbing through media. When enabled, the server will generate low-resolution preview images of the media at regular intervals, allowing for quick seeking without needing to transcode the media. This can be especially useful for long media files, such as movies or TV shows.\nFor trickplay, I recommend enabling hardware decoding and hardware accelerated MJPEG encoding. For the remainder of the settings, I find that the default settings work well, although you can adjust them to your liking. The more frequently the server generates preview images, the smoother seeking will be, but this will also increase the load on your server. One thing to note is that the first run of trickplay will take a long time to generate the preview images, but subsequent runs will be much faster as the server will only need to generate preview images for new media or media that has been played since the last run.\n\n\nScheduled Tasks\nScheduled tasks allow your server to run certain operations automatically, keeping the server optimized and metadata up to date. Tasks can be set to run daily, weekly, after a certain time interval, and/or every time the server starts up. Additionally, a time limit can be set on the tasks to prevent them from running too long.\nOn my server, I have every scheduled task set to run daily at 1:00am, allowing them to run and finish while I’m very unlikely to be using the server. Nearly all of the tasks run in less than a minute, so running them weekly would likely be just fine, although the longer you go without running the tasks, the longer they may take.\nMy recommendation is to start by setting all the tasks to run weekly in the early-morning and adjust from there.\n\n\nPlugins\nJellyfin comes with the ability to install plugins, with nearly 40 able to be easily installed within the server settings. These allow you to pull metadata from more sources, download subtitles from the internet, and have more administrative tools.\nTo install a plugin, simply click the plugin you want to install, click install, and restart your server. To uninstall, click on the installed plugin, click uninstall, and restart your server.",

    "section": "Connecting Outside Your Network",
    "text": "Connecting Outside Your Network\nMost users will want access to their media library outside of their home network. To do this, there are two main options: Port forwarding, and tunneling.\n\nPort Forwarding\nPort forwarding involves opening a specific port on your router and directing traffic on that port to your server. This allows you to access your server from anywhere with an internet connection by entering your public IP address and the forwarded port into your browser.\nI personally have not used port forwarding due to moving between networks and having little to no access to the the routers. However, here is a good source on how to set up port forwarding: How to Set Up Port Forwarding.\nIf you move your server between networks relatively frequently or do not have access to the router, I recommend using a tunneling service instead.\n\n\nTunneling\nTunneling services create a secure connection between your server and an external server, allowing you to access your server without needing to open ports on your router. This is particularly useful if you are unable to configure port forwarding on your router, or if you want to avoid the security risks associated with opening ports.\nBelow are some tunneling services I’ve used; I’ve also linked a GitHub page with a more comprehensive list.\n\nPlayit.gg: Playit.gg provides limited capabilities in exchange for free use. This service will work when starting out, although other options are better if more configurability or easier sharing are desired.\nLocaltonet: Localtonet is a paid tunneling service with a free tier. Like Playit.gg, the free tier is quite limited, but sufficient for trying out the service. Paid plans allow you to use custom domains and keep the tunnel open 24/7.\nPinggy: Like Localtonet, Pinggy is a paid tunneling service with a free tier. The free tier is still quite limited, but is still sufficient for testing out the service. Pinggy also allows custom domains and 24/7 tunnels on paid plans.\nOther Options: There are many other tunneling services available, including those at different prices, having different capabilities, and some being open-source. A good list of options is anderspitman’s awesome-tunneling on GitHub.",

    "text": "Creating and managing accounts for your media server.\n\nCreating accounts\nTo create an account, navigate to the “Users” section of your media server’s settings. From there, you can add new users by providing a username, password, and choose which libraries the user will have access to. After this, you can further customize the user’s profile and access permissions.\n\n\nManaging accounts\n\nProfile\nThe profile section provides the most customization of the user account. Here, you can set a profile picture, change the username, and customize the user’s preferences for how they cam view and interact with the media server. Additionally, you can give certain users administrative privileges, allowing them to manage the server and other user accounts.\nThis section also provides quality of life options, such as limiting the bitrate a user can stream at and setting a maximum number of simultaneous streams for the user. This can be useful for managing bandwidth and ensuring a smooth streaming experience for all users on the server.\n\n\nAccess\nThe access section allows you to control which libraries a user can access and which devices a user can login from. These features can be used to limit where a user can access the media server and what content they can view. For example, you can restrict a user to only access the media server from certain devices, such as a smart TV or a mobile device, and limit their access to specific libraries, such as only allowing them to view movies but not TV shows.\n\n\nParental Controls\nParental controls allow you to restrict access to certain content based on ratings. This can be useful for managing what content is appropriate for different users, such as children. You can set a maximum allowed rating for movies and TV shows, and any content that exceeds that rating will be hidden from the user. Additionally, media can be blocked or allowed based on tags, such as blocking all content tagged with “horror” or allowing all content tagged with “family”. Finally, an access schedule can be set to restrict when a user can access the media server, such as only allowing access during certain hours of the day.",

    "text": "Hardware Selection\n\nProcessor\n\nUsing Integrated Graphics\nMost desktop Intel and Apple-branded processors made since ~2021 will be sufficient for running Jellyfin, however AMD processors are not recommended. Below is a list of good processor options:\n\nIntel Core i5 11400, 11500, 11600, 12400, 12500, 12600, 13400, 13500, 13600, 14400, 14500, and 14600\nIntel Core i7 11700, 12700, 13700, and 14700\nIntel Core i9 11900, 12900, 13900, and 14900\nApple M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 (Including Pro, Max, and Ultra variants)\n\nMany of the Intel processors have options with letters appended to the end of the model. Avoid models with “F” or “KF”, as those do not have integrated graphics. This will result in no desktop image without a seperate video card and Jellyfin being unable to transcode content. Models with “U”, “H”, or “P” appended to the model are designed for mobile devices. Such processors will work, however performance will be lesser than the equivalent desktop processor.\n\n\nUsing Dedicated Graphics\nIf you’re planning on doing a lot of transcoding, streaming 4K video, or allowing many people access to your server, a dedigated graphics card may be a good idea.\nSince the integrated graphics on the processor will not be responsible for server use, additional processor options become available. Below is a list of additional processor options:\n\nIntel Core i5 8400, 8500, 8600, 9400, 9500, 9600, 10400, 10500, and 10600\nIntel Core i7 8700, 8086K, 9700, and 10700\nIntel Core i9 9900, 10850, and 10900\nAMD Ryzen 5 2500, 2600, 3500, 3600, 4500, 4600, 5500, 5600, 7400, 7500, 7600, 8400, 8500, 8600, 9500, and 9600\nAMD Ryzen 7 2700, 3700, 3800, 4700, 5700, 5800, 7700, 7800, 8700, 9700, 9800, and 9850\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950, 5900, 7900, 7950, 9900, and 9950\n\nIn addition to the Intel processors listed, models with “F” or “KF” appended to the model will work, since the integrated graphics will not be needed.\nMany of the AMD processors have “G”, “XT”, “F”, “X”, and/or “X3D” variants. Any models with any of those identifiers will work. Similar to Intel, models with “U” or “H” identifiers are primarily used in mobile devices and will have lesser performance compared to the equivalent desktop processor.\n\n\n\nStorage\nThe amount of storage required in your server will depend on what kinds of media you intend to store, how much media you will be storing, and the quality if your media. Additionally, less storage is necessary if you compress media from its original state. Below is a list of the storage required for several common types of media:\n\n\n\nMedia Type\nStorage Required\n\n\n\n\nPhoto\n1-10 megabytes\n\n\neBook\n1 megabyte - 1 gigabyte\n\n\nPhone Video\n40-500 megabytes/min\n\n\nCD\n700 megabytes\n\n\nVHS Tape\n1-15 gigabytes/hr\n\n\nDVD\n4.7-8.5 gigabytes\n\n\nBlu-Ray\n25-50 gigabytes\n\n\n4K Blu-Ray\n50-100 gigabytes\n\n\n\nBased on the numbers above, here are a few use cases and the amount of storage I would recommend:\n\nFor backing up photos and videos from your phone or camera, it’s unlikely you’ll need more than 1 terabyte of storage.\nSimilarly, if you back up CDs to your server, you shouldn’t need more than 1 terabyte, unless you have a very extensive collection.\nIf you will be backing up DVDs and/or VHS tapes, 2-4 terabytes should be enough storage; Extensive collections may require 6-8 terabytes.\nArchiving Blu-Ray discs to your server will require a lot of storage. A small to medium collection would require about 10-20 terabytes, while an extensive collection may require at least 50 terabytes.\n\n\n\nHardware Notes\nIf choosing a graphics card for transcoding, avoid all AMD cards and any card made before ~2016. When using the default settings, the encoder in AMD cards do not perform as well as the encoder in Intel and Nvidia cards. As for age, most cards dating back to the Nvidia 10-series and Intel Arc A-series will support most encoding formats. For AV1 encoding, all recent Intel cards will work, however Nvidia did not introduce the feature until the RTX 40-series.\nFor a server running windows, 16-32 gigabytes of memory is recommended for the system. On lighter-weight Linux systems, 8 gigabytes will work fine for a basic server, however if additional programs (such as VPNs, antivirus, archival tools, etc.) will also be running, 16 gigabytes would be a better option.",

    "text": "Adding live television to your server.\n\nWhat is IPTV?\nIPTV is a method of delivering television content over the internet. It allows you to stream live TV channels and on-demand content to your devices without the need for traditional cable or satellite TV services. IPTV can be used with various media server software, such as Jellyfin, Plex, and EmuDeck, to provide a seamless TV viewing experience. While IPTV works with many types of media server software, I will be discussing it in relation to Jellyfin.\n\n\nSetting Up IPTV\nTo add live TV to your server, you will need to set up an IPTV tuner. An easy way to add this capability is to add an M3U tuner device, copy an IPTV playlist in (whether that be a file or a link), and saving. It will take a few minutes to load everything in, but once it does, you will have access to all the channels in the playlist. A good source of channels to start out with is iptv by iptv-org.\n\n\nChannel Guide\nAdding a channel guide can be a little more challenging than getting basic live TV set up. The easiest method is using Schedules Direct, which is a built-in option in Jellyfin. However, the service does require payment after the first 7 days. A good free option to check out is epg by iptv-org, which provides free channel guide data for many channels. Instructions on how to use this data with Jellyfin can be found in the GitHub repository linked above. A third, but more involved option is to use XMLTV data, which is a standard format for TV guide data. This method requires more technical knowledge and regular updating by the user. Finally, if you have a TV tuner card, you can use the channel guide data provided by your TV tuner software, such as HDHomeRun.\n\n\nDVR Setup\nOnce you have the channel guide set up, you will be able to record programs to watch later. To set up DVR, navigate to the “Live TV” section of your media server’s settings and select “DVR”. From there, you can configure your recording settings, such as the storage location for recorded programs and the recording quality. You can also set up recording schedules to automatically record specific programs or channels at certain times. This allows you to easily keep up with your favorite shows and never miss an episode again.",
